# Doing a 64 bit build issues a warning that this is experimental
# on every file and we don't want that to kill the build.
# We also suppress unused warnings until the corresponding PR lands.

# We ask that memory growth be enabled rather than hardcoding
# the size of the WebAssembly memory.
# The limited postlink optimizations warning is from binaryen
# and emcc when debug info is requested in an optimized build
# as not all optimizations will be run in that scenario.
