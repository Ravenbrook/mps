Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This document describes reference sets -- conservative
approximations to sets of references -- which are widely used in the
Memory Pool System to optimise garbage collection.


Overview
--------


Implementation
--------------

_`.type`: Reference sets are represented in the MPS by the type
``RefSet`` which is a pointer to a structure of type ``RefSetStruct``.

_`.type.just`: A structure type is chosen to make it easy to
experiment with representations of reference sets.


Improvement ideas
-----------------

Generalised placement
.....................

.improv.placement: Generalise design.mps.arenavm.req.fun.place for
other reference set properties, not just zones.
