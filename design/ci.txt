[Mention how CI supports the pull request merge procedure (except that
exists on a separate branch at the moment).  RB 2023-01-15]


Implementation
==============

Services
--------

_`.service`: The `Ravenbrook MPS repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps>`_ uses third-party continuous
integration services.

_`.service.github`: `GitHub CI`_ uses `GitHub Actions
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`__ to trigger builds on
`GitHub-hosted runners
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners>`_
and can orchestrate external "`self-hosted runners
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners>`__".

- `GitHub CI`_ is free to use for public repositories.

- `GitHub CI`_ only provides hosted runners for amd64.

- `GitHub CI`_ does not support FreeBSD, even for self-hosted runners.

- There is a hazard of GitHub lock-in.

- `GitHub CI`_ is also used to run checks (`.run.other.checks`_).

_`.service.cirrus`: `Cirrus CI`_ mainly uses Google Compute Cloud to
run public images, mainly Docker images.

- `Cirrus CI`_ is free to use for public repositories.

- `Cirrus CI`_ provides macOS M1 (Apple Silicon) using `Tart
  <https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart>`_ and so can provide coverage
  for XCA6LL.

- `Cirrus CI`_ can orchestrate Amazon EC2 for extra control.

- `Cirrus CI`_ can provide FreeBSD on amd64 but not arm64.

_`.service.travis`: `Travis CI`_ is a commercial system that
provides a wide variety of platforms and simple configuration.

- `Travis CI`_ is a paid service with limited concurrency.

- `Travis CI is slow and expensive`_

- Ravenbrook has negotiated a quota of "OSS credits" with Travis for
  the public MPS repo.

_`.service.readthedocs`: `Read the Docs`_ is used to `.build`_ and
`.publish`_ the `MPS manual
<https://memory-pool-system.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. _GitHub CI: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration

.. _Cirrus CI: https://cirrus-ci.com/

.. _Travis CI: https://travis-ci.com/

.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org/

.. _Travis CI is slow and expensive: https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/issues/109

_`.service.choice`: Favour the services higher up this list when
making changes.  [Why? Cost. Stability. RB 2023-02-09]

[Previous text on service choice:

_`.travis.platforms`: Where possible, we use `GitHub CI`_ for
platforms, because `Travis CI is slow and expensive`_.  However
`GitHub CI`_ does not provide ARM64 or FreeBSD, so we use `Travis CI`_
for those.

RB 2023-02-09]


Platforms
---------

_`.platforms`: This table shows how each defined platform [ref? RB
2023-02-09] is built and tested by CI.

==========   ============   =====================================
Platform     Service        Notes
==========   ============   =====================================
``anangc``   [policy?]      not "supported", testing only
``ananll``   [policy?]      not "supported", testing only
``fra6gc``   `Travis CI`_   not "supported"
``fra6ll``   `Travis CI`_   not "supported"
``fri3gc``   none
``fri3ll``   none
``fri6gc``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no FreeBSD
``fri6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no FreeBSD
``lia6gc``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no arm64, not supported
``lia6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no arm64, not supported
``lii3gc``   none
``lii6gc``   `GitHub CI`_
``lii6ll``   `GitHub CI`_
``w3i3mv``   none
``w3i6mv``   `GitHub CI`_
``xca6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   Cirrus has Tart
``xci6ll``   `GitHub CI`_
==========   ============   =====================================

_`.platform.supported`: The platforms here must be a superset of the platforms
listed as "supported" in readme.txt.

_`.platform.builds`: The platforms here must be a subset of the
platforms listed in "Building the MPS" manual/build.txt, but
preferably the same set so that CI covers all defined platforms.


Commands
--------

_`.run.posix`: On Posix systems where we have `autoconf
<https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>`_, the CI services run
commands equivalent to::

  ./configure
  make install
  make test

which execises the testci target, as defined by `Makefile.in
<../Makefile.in>`_ in the root of the MPS tree.

_`.run.windows`: On Windows the CI services run commands that do at
least::

  nmake /f w3i6mv.nmk all testci

as defined by the `.github.config`_.

_`.run.other.targets`: On some platforms we arrange to run the testansi,
testpollnone, testratio, and testscheme targets.  [Need to explain
why, where, etc.  RB 2023-01-15]

_`.run.other.checks`: We could also run various non-build checks
using CI to check:

- document formatting
- shell script syntax

[In the branch of writing, these do not yet exist.  They are the
subject of `GitHub pull request #113
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/pull/112>`_ of
branch/2023-01-13/rst-check.  When merged, they can be linked.  RB
2023-01-15]


Events
------

_`.when:`: CI is triggered on the `mps GitHub repo`_ by:

- commits (pushes)
- new pull requests
- manually, using `.tools`_

.. _mps GitHub repo: https://github.com/ravenbrook/mps


Results
-------

_`.results`: CI results are visible via the GitHub web interface:

- in pull requests, under "Checks",

- on the `branches page <https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/branches>`_
  as green ticks or red crosses that link to details.

as well as in logs specific to the type of CI.

_`.results.github`: Results from `GitHub CI`_ can be found at `build
and test actions on the Actions tab at the Ravenbrook GitHub repo
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml>`_.

_`.results.cirrus`: Results from `Cirrus CI`_ can be found at
`Ravenbrook/mps - Cirrus CI
<https://cirrus-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps>`_.

_`.results.travis`: Results from `Travis CI`_ can be found at `Travis
CI build history for the MPS GitHub repo
<https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps/builds>`_.

_`.results.readthedocs`: Results from `Read the Docs`_ can be found at
`Builds | Read the Docs
<https://readthedocs.org/projects/memory-pool-system/builds/>`_.


Configuration
-------------

_`.github.config`: GitHub CI is configured using the
`build-and-test.yml <../.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml>`_ file
in the .github/workflows directory of the MPS tree.

_`.travis.config`: Travis is configured using the `.travis.yml
<../.travis.yml>`_ file at top level of the MPS tree.


Tools
-----

_`.tools`: The MPS tree contains some simple tools for managing CI
without the need to install whole packages such as the GitHub CLI or
Travis CI's Ruby gem.

_`.tools.kick`: `tool/github-ci-kick <../tool/github-ci-kick>`_ and
`tool/travis-ci-kick <../tool/travis-ci-kick>`_ both trigger CI builds
without the need to push a change or make a pull request in the `mps
GitHub repo`_.  In particular, they are useful for applying CI to work
that was pushed while CI was disabled, for whatever reason.

[FIXME: No cirrus-ci-kick?  Read the Docs kick?  RB 2023-02-09]
