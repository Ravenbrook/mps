Introduction
============

_`.intro`: This document describes the design and implementation of
`continuous integration
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ of the Memory
Pool System.

_`.levels`: The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119 [RFC-2119]_.  They indicate what is requried for
the design to succeed in achieving its goals.


Goals
=====

_`.goal.platforms`: Reduce the cost to developers and collaborators of
supporting target platforms.

_`.goal.detect`: Detect introduced defects early in development so that
they can be fixed at lower cost.

_`.goal.publish`: Publish documentation promptly and cheaply.


Requirements
============

_`.req.rapid`: Provide build and test results within 30 minutes of
submission of changes.  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.branch`: Provide build and test results for submissions to
development branches (pushes).  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.merge`: Provide build and test results for merge candidate changes
(pull requests) before they are merged to master.  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.platforms`: Build and test on all supported target platforms
defined in `Building the Memory Pool System <../manual/build.txt>`_
(`.goal.platforms`_).  [TODO: The target platforms should be referencable
by tag.  See also `GitHub issue #147
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/issues/147>`_.  RB 2023-03-08]

_`.req.cost`: Cost no money in normal circumstances.  (This also
supports `.req.fork`_) (`.goal.platforms`_, `.goal.detect`_,
`.goal.publish`_)

_`.req.fork`: Operate on forks of the repo, to further promote early
detection. (`.goal.platforms`_, `.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.maintainable`: Low maintenance overhead.  Around 20 h/year,
which is about 1% of a person.  (`.goal.platforms`_)

_`.req.extensible`: Easy to extend with new platforms, improvements,
and defect prevention.  Less than 4 h of work to add a new platform or
check (not including the development of the port or check).
(`.goal.platforms`_, `.goal.publish`_)

_`.req.portable`: Be portable away from any particular hosting
service, e.g. GitHub, in less than 40 h of work.  (`.goal.platforms`_,
`.goal.publish`_)

_`.req.admin`: Administration is available to more than one person in
the organization.  (`.goal.platforms`_, `.goal.publish`_)

_`.req.manual`: Publish the manual.  [TODO: Define where, how prompty,
etc.  RB 2023-03-17]

_`.req.manual.versions`: Publish versions of the manual that document
releases.  [TODO: Connect with version and release procedures.  RB
2023-03-17]

_`.req.build.code`: Check that the MPS code compiles correctly without
errors or warnings.

_`.req.build.manual`: Check that the manual builds correctly without
errors or warnings.

_`.req.test`: Detect defects detected by tests
(`design.mps.tests`_) on target platforms.  (`.goal.detect`_)

.. _design.mps.tests: tests.txt

_`.req.test.coverage`: Includes all CI tests
(`design.mps.tests.target.testci`_).  (`.goal.detect`_,
`.goal.platforms`_) [TODO: This is a circular definition.  What
determines whether a test is in this set?  RB 2023-03-17]

.. _design.mps.tests.target.testci: tests.txt#target-testci

_`.req.test.detect`: Detect wheter tests find any defects.  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.test.results`: Provide detailed test results to diagnose defects.
(`.goal.platforms`_)

_`.req.test.real`: Test the attributes of realistic target platforms,
e.g. test interacting with the real target kernel rather than a
virtualized simulation.  This is especially important for performance
tests.  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.test.type`: Test for all the types defects for which we have
tests.  [TODO: Analyse and specify explicitly what types of tests are
required, probably in `design.mps.tests`_, and reference here.  RB
2023-03-08.]

_`.req.check`: Detect defects detected by programmatic checks
(`.def.check`_) of the MPS source tree.

_`.def.check`: A "check", as opposed to a "test" of the compiled MPS, is
something that e.g. finds missing cross-references, inconsistencies,
or runs a lint tool.

_`.req.check.coverage`: Include all checks.  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.check.detect`: Detect whether checks find any defects.  (`.goal.detect`_)

_`.req.check.results`: Provide detailed results of checks.  (`.goal.platforms`_)

[TODO: What is required about *version* of platforms, e.g. kernel
versions, compiler versions, etc.?  RB 2023-03-08]


Design
======

Configuration
-------------

_`.config`: CI systems are usually configured though simple YAML files
that give instructions for what to do on various events.

_`.config.kiss`: CI setups SHOULD be kept as simple as possible to meet
`.req.maintainable`_ and `.req.portable`_.

_`.config.one-line`: Each CI configuration SHOULD be a single command
line that invokes part of the MPS build system.  (See `.run.posix`_
and `.run.windows`_.)

_`.config.cross-platform`: The `.config.one-line`_ command SHOULD
invoke a platform independent script, so that we get uniform coverage
of platforms.  For example, ``test/check-rst`` or ``make testci``.
Unfortunately, Windows often demands a different script.  Duplication
for Windows SHOULD be minimized.

_`.github.config`: `GitHub CI`_ is configured using several
`"workflows"
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows>`__
in the `.github/workflows directory <../.github/workflows/>`_ of the
MPS tree:

- the `build-and-test.yml <../.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml>`_
  file runs build and test commands (`.run.posix`_ , `.run.windows`_).

- the `shell-script-check.yml
  <../.github/workflows/shell-script-check.yml>`_ file runs the
  lint checks on shell scripts

- the `rst-check.yml <../.github/workflows/shell-script-check.yml>`_
  file runs syntax checks on reStructuredText documents

_`.cirrus.config`: `Cirrus CI`_ is configured using the `.cirrus.yml
<../.cirrus.yml>`_ file at top level of the MPS tree.

_`.travis.config`: `Travis CI`_ is configured using the `.travis.yml
<../.travis.yml>`_ file at top level of the MPS tree.

_`.readthedocs.config`: `Read the Docs`_ is configured using the
`.readthedocs.yml <../.readthedocs.yml>`_ file at the top level of the
MPS tree.


Administration
--------------

_`.github.admin`: `GitHub CI`_ is build on GitHub Actions, which are
managed in `the Actions section of the MPS repo settings
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/settings/actions>`__.  The repo
uses the default settings.

_`.cirrus.admin`: `Cirrus CI`_ is managed in the `Settings for
Ravenbrook page of the Cirrus CI app
<https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/Ravenbrook>`__.  The settings
are defaults.

_`.cirrus.github`: `Cirrus CI`_ uses a GitHub app to monitor activity
in the MPS repo and kick off builds.  The app is managed in the
`GitHub apps section of the MPS repo settings
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/settings/installations>`__.  The
settings are defaults.

_`.travis.admin`: `Travis CI`_ is managed on the `Ravenbrook / mps
page of the Travis CI app
<https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps>`__ but the *account
plan* is managed on the `Ravenbrook plan page
<https://app.travis-ci.com/organizations/Ravenbrook/plan>`__.

_`.travis.github`: `Travis CI`_ uses a GitHub app to monitor activity
in the MPS repo and kick off builds.  The app is managed in the
`GitHub apps section of the MPS repo settings
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/settings/installations>`__.  The
settings are defaults.

_`.readthedocs.admin`: `Read the Docs`_ is managed on the `Memory Pool
System project page
<https://readthedocs.org/projects/memory-pool-system/>`__.  [FIXME:
Write about managing Read the Docs versions and builds.  RB
2023-03-16]


Checks
------

_`.design.check.script`: Checks SHOULD be implemented as executable
scripts in the tool directory at the root of the MPS tree.  This keeps
the CI config simple (`.config.kiss`_) and allows checks, like builds,
to be run by developers from the command line (`.goal.detect`_).

_`.design.check.posix`: Checks MUST run on Posix.  Checks MAY also run
on Windows.  Checks SHOULD run on Posix layered on Windows, such
`WSL`_.  The majority of CI systems run on Posix, which includes
macOS.  Linux features that are not available in macOS (which is based
on BSD) SHOULD NOT be used.

.. _WSL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about

_`.design.check.cross-platform`: Checks SHOULD be designed to be
independent of target platforms, so that defects in the Windows build
are detected by checks run on Posix.  Therefore, checks SHOULD NOT
exclude files by platform (`.goal.detect`_).


Implementation
==============

Services
--------

_`.service`: The `Ravenbrook MPS repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps>`_ uses third-party continuous
integration services in order to meet `.req.platforms`_,
`.req.maintainable`_, and `.req.extensible`_ without the overhead of
maintaining a lot systems.

_`.service.choice`: The services have been chosen to best meet
requirements, with the best fit earliest in the list.  Therefore, we
SHOULD favour the services higher up this list when making changes.

[TODO: Is `.req.test.real`_ adequately met?  RB 2023-03-08]

_`.service.github`: `GitHub CI`_ uses `GitHub Actions
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`__ to trigger builds on
`GitHub-hosted runners
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners>`_
and can orchestrate external "`self-hosted runners
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners>`__".

- `GitHub CI`_ is free to use for public repositories (`.req.cost`_).

- `GitHub CI`_ only provides hosted runners for amd64 (`.req.platforms`_).

- `GitHub CI`_ does not support FreeBSD, even for self-hosted runners (`.req.platforms`_).

- There is a hazard of GitHub lock-in (`.req.portable`_).

- `GitHub CI`_ is also used to run checks (`.run.checks`_, `.req.check`_).

- `GitHub CI`_ builds both `pushes and pull requests
  <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges>`__
  (`.req.branch`_, `.req.merge`_).

_`.service.cirrus`: `Cirrus CI`_ mainly uses Google Compute Cloud to
run public images, mainly Docker images.

- `Cirrus CI`_ is free to use for public repositories (`.req.cost`_).

- `Cirrus CI`_ provides macOS M1 (Apple Silicon) using `Tart
  <https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart>`_ and so can provide coverage
  for XCA6LL (`.req.platforms`_).

- `Cirrus CI`_ can orchestrate Amazon EC2 for extra control, though we
  don't currently use this feature.  It could be used to meet
  `.req.test.real`_.

- `Cirrus CI`_ can provide FreeBSD on amd64 but not arm64
  (`.req.platforms`_).

- `Cirrus CI`_ builds either pushes or pull requests, but not both.
  [TODO: Escalate `my workaround
  <https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/discussions/1110#discussioncomment-4917295>`__
  or figure out how to fix it.  RB 2023-03-08]

_`.service.travis`: `Travis CI`_ is a commercial system that provides
a wide variety of platforms and simple configuration
(`.req.maintainable`_).

- `Travis CI`_ is a paid service with limited concurrency (`.req.cost`_).

- `Travis CI is slow and expensive`_ (`.req.cost`_, `.req.rapid`_).

- Ravenbrook has negotiated a quota of "OSS credits" with Travis for
  the public MPS repo [Travis_42376]_.

- `Travis CI`_ builds both `pushes and pull requests
  <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#how-pull-requests-are-built>`__
  (`.req.branch`_, `.req.merge`_).

_`.service.readthedocs`: `Read the Docs`_ is used build and publish
the `MPS manual <https://memory-pool-system.readthedocs.io/>`_
(`.req.manual`_, `.req.build.manual`_).

- `Read the Docs`_ builds `pull requests
  <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html#preview-documentation-from-pull-requests>`__
  automatically, and can build `branches
  <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html#versioned-documentation>`__
  (`.req.branch`_, `.req.merge`_).

Platforms
---------

_`.platforms`: This table shows how each defined platform
(`.req.platforms`_) is built and tested by CI.

==========   ============   =====================================
Platform     Service        Notes
==========   ============   =====================================
``anangc``   [policy?]      not "supported", testing only
``ananll``   [policy?]      not "supported", testing only
``fra6gc``   `Travis CI`_   not "supported"
``fra6ll``   `Travis CI`_   not "supported"
``fri3gc``   none
``fri3ll``   none
``fri6gc``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no FreeBSD
``fri6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no FreeBSD
``lia6gc``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no arm64, not supported
``lia6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no arm64, not supported
``lii3gc``   none
``lii6gc``   `GitHub CI`_
``lii6ll``   `GitHub CI`_
``w3i3mv``   none
``w3i6mv``   `GitHub CI`_
``xca6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   Cirrus has Tart
``xci6ll``   `GitHub CI`_
==========   ============   =====================================

_`.platform.supported`: The platforms here MUST be a superset of the
platforms listed as "supported" in readme.txt (`.req.platforms`_).

_`.platform.builds`: The platforms here MUST be a subset of the
platforms listed in "Building the MPS" manual/build.txt, but SHOULD be
the same set so that CI covers all defined platforms (`.req.platforms`_).


Commands
--------

_`.run.posix`: On Posix systems where we have `autoconf
<https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>`_, the CI services run
commands equivalent to::

  ./configure && make install && make test

which execises the testci target, as defined by `Makefile.in
<../Makefile.in>`_ in the root of the MPS tree.  (See
`.config.one-line`_.)

_`.run.windows`: On Windows the CI services run commands that do at
least::

  nmake /f w3i6mv.nmk all testci

as defined by the `.github.config`_.  (See `.config.one-line`_.)

_`.run.other.targets`: On some platforms we arrange to run the
testansi, testpollnone, testratio, and testscheme targets.  [TODO:
Investigate and explain why, where, etc.  RB 2023-01-15]

_`.run.manual`: The manual is built by Read the Docs which `directly
invokes Sphinx
<https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html#sphinx>`__,
so there are no commands.

_`.run.checks`: We also run various non-build checks using CI to check
things like document formatting and lint shell scripts.  Each of these
runs a single command like::

  tool/check-rst

(see `.design.check.script`_).


Events
------

_`.when:`: CI is triggered on the `mps GitHub repo`_ by:

- commits (pushes)
- new pull requests
- manually, using `.tools`_

.. _mps GitHub repo: https://github.com/ravenbrook/mps


Results
-------

_`.results`: CI results are visible via the GitHub web interface:

- in pull requests, under "Checks",

- on the `branches page <https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/branches>`_
  as green ticks or red crosses that link to details.

as well as in logs specific to the type of CI.

_`.results.github`: Results from `GitHub CI`_ can be found at `build
and test actions on the Actions tab at the Ravenbrook GitHub repo
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml>`_.

_`.results.cirrus`: Results from `Cirrus CI`_ can be found at
`Ravenbrook/mps - Cirrus CI
<https://cirrus-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps>`_.

_`.results.travis`: Results from `Travis CI`_ can be found at `Travis
CI build history for the MPS GitHub repo
<https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps/builds>`_.

_`.results.readthedocs`: Results from `Read the Docs`_ can be found at
`Builds | Read the Docs
<https://readthedocs.org/projects/memory-pool-system/builds/>`_.


Tools
-----

_`.tools`: The MPS tree contains some simple tools for managing CI
without the need to install whole packages such as the GitHub CLI or
Travis CI's Ruby gem.

_`.tools.kick`: `tool/github-ci-kick <../tool/github-ci-kick>`_ and
`tool/travis-ci-kick <../tool/travis-ci-kick>`_ both trigger CI builds
without the need to push a change or make a pull request in the `mps
GitHub repo`_.  In particular, they are useful for applying CI to work
that was pushed while CI was disabled, for whatever reason.  There are
currently no kick scripts for `Cirrus CI`_ or `Read the Docs`_.  As of
2023-03 they haven't been needed.
