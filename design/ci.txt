.. TODO: Readership could be a role that doesn't include MPS
   programmers.

.. TODO: Discussion of compilers and toolchains.

.. TODO: Discussion of *versions* of platforms, e.g. whether and how
   we specify compiler versions to CI.


Introduction
============

_`.intro`: This document describes the design and implementation of
`continuous integration
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ of the Memory
Pool System.


Goals
=====

.goal.platforms: Reduce the cost to developers and collaborators of
supporting target platforms.  [Cross-reference to where those are
defined.  RB 2023-02-26]

.goal.detect: Detect introduced defects early in development so that
they can be fixed at lower cost.

.goal.publish: Publish documentation promptly and cheaply.


Requirements
============

.req.rapid: Provide build and test results within 30 minutes of
submission of changes.  (goal.detect)

.req.branch: Provide build and test results for submissions to
development branches (pushes).  (goal.detect)

.req.merge: Provide build and test results for merge candidate changes
(pull requests) before they are merged to master.  (goal.detect)

.req.platforms: Build and test on all supported target platforms.
(goal.platforms)

.req.cost: Cost no money in normal circumstances.  (This also supports
.req.fork.)  (goal.platforms, goal.detect, goal.publish)

.req.fork: Operate on forks of the repo.  (goal.platforms, goal.detect)

.req.maintinable: Low maintenance overhead.  [Around 20 h/year or 1%.
RB 2023-02-26] (goal.platforms)

.req.extensible: Easy to extend with new platforms, improvements, and
defect prevention.  (goal.platforms, goal.publish)

.req.portable: Be portable away from any particular hosting service,
e.g. GitHub, at reasonable cost.  (goal.platforms, goal.publish)

.req.admin: Administration is available to more than one person.
(goal.platforms, goal,publish)

.req.manual: Publish the manual.

.req.manual.versions: Publish versions of the manual that document
releases.

.req.build.code: Check that changed code compiles correctly without
errors or warnings.

.req.build.manual: Check that the manual builds correctly without
errors or warnings.

.req.test: Allow the running of tests (.def.test) on target platforms.
(goal.detect)

.def.test: A "test" is something that runs the compiled MPS in order
to determine facts about it: find defects, check performance, etc.

.req.test.coverage: Includes all tests.  (goal.detect, goal.platforms)

.req.test.detect: Detect wheter tests find any defects.  (goal.detect)

.req.test.results: Provide detailed test results to diagnose defects.
(goal.platforms)

.req.test.real: Test realistic target platforms, e.g. test interacting
with the real target kernel rather than a virtualized simulation.
(goal.detect)

[To include:

- What kinds of defects to find by testing (functional, performance, etc.)

RB 2023-02-10]

.req.check: Allow programmatic checks (.def.check) of the MPS source
tree.

.def.check: A "check", as opposed to a "test" of the compiled MPS, is
something that e.g. finds missing cross-references, inconsistencies,
or runs a lint tool.

.req.check.coverage: Include all checks.  (goal.detect)

.req.check.detect: Detect whether checks find any defects.  (goal.detect)

.req.check.results: Provide detailed results of checks.  (goal.platforms)




Design
======

CI configurations
-----------------

.design.config: CI systems are usually configured though simple YAML
files that give instructions for what to do on various events.

.design.config.kiss: Keep the CI setups and configurations as simple
as possible to meet .req.maintainable and .req.portable.

.design.config.one-line: As far as possible, each CI configuration
should be a single command line that invokes part of the MPS build
system.  Something like ``./configure && make all testci``.

.design.config.cross-platform: The .design.config.one-line command
should invoke a platform independent script, so that we get uniform
coverage of platforms.  For example, ``test/check-rst`` or ``make
testci``.  Unfortunately, Windows often demands a different script.
Minimise duplication on Windows.


Checks
------

.design.check.posix: Checks must run on Posix but may also run on
Windows.  The majority of CI systems run on Posix, with macOS as a
special case.  Linux features that are not available in macOS (which
is based on BSD) should not be used.

.design.check.cross-platform: Checks should be designed to be
independent of platforms, so that defects in the Windows build are
detected by checks run on Posix.  Therefore, checks should not exclude
files by platform.

[TODO: Review against each requirement and each implementation point.
Design connects them.  RB 2023-02-26]

[For inclusion:
- use third-party CI systems (req.cost, req.platforms, req.maintainable)
- do third-party CI systems represent real platforms? (req.platforms)
- the testci make target
- third-party systems used
- relationship to review
- relationship to merge
- configuration files
- tool scripts
- how to extend
- KISS
- forks
- 32-bit?

Implementation
==============

Services
--------

_`.service`: The `Ravenbrook MPS repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps>`_ uses third-party continuous
integration services.

_`.service.github`: `GitHub CI`_ uses `GitHub Actions
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`__ to trigger builds on
`GitHub-hosted runners
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners>`_
and can orchestrate external "`self-hosted runners
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners>`__".

- `GitHub CI`_ is free to use for public repositories.

- `GitHub CI`_ only provides hosted runners for amd64.

- `GitHub CI`_ does not support FreeBSD, even for self-hosted runners.

- There is a hazard of GitHub lock-in.

- `GitHub CI`_ is also used to run checks (`.run.other.checks`_).

_`.service.cirrus`: `Cirrus CI`_ mainly uses Google Compute Cloud to
run public images, mainly Docker images.

- `Cirrus CI`_ is free to use for public repositories.

- `Cirrus CI`_ provides macOS M1 (Apple Silicon) using `Tart
  <https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart>`_ and so can provide coverage
  for XCA6LL.

- `Cirrus CI`_ can orchestrate Amazon EC2 for extra control.

- `Cirrus CI`_ can provide FreeBSD on amd64 but not arm64.

_`.service.travis`: `Travis CI`_ is a commercial system that
provides a wide variety of platforms and simple configuration.

- `Travis CI`_ is a paid service with limited concurrency.

- `Travis CI is slow and expensive`_

- Ravenbrook has negotiated a quota of "OSS credits" with Travis for
  the public MPS repo.

_`.service.readthedocs`: `Read the Docs`_ is used to `.build`_ and
`.publish`_ the `MPS manual
<https://memory-pool-system.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. _GitHub CI: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration

.. _Cirrus CI: https://cirrus-ci.com/

.. _Travis CI: https://travis-ci.com/

.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org/

.. _Travis CI is slow and expensive: https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/issues/109

_`.service.choice`: Favour the services higher up this list when
making changes.  [Why? Cost. Stability. RB 2023-02-09]

[Previous text on service choice:

_`.travis.platforms`: Where possible, we use `GitHub CI`_ for
platforms, because `Travis CI is slow and expensive`_.  However
`GitHub CI`_ does not provide ARM64 or FreeBSD, so we use `Travis CI`_
for those.

RB 2023-02-09]


Platforms
---------

_`.platforms`: This table shows how each defined platform [ref? RB
2023-02-09] is built and tested by CI.

==========   ============   =====================================
Platform     Service        Notes
==========   ============   =====================================
``anangc``   [policy?]      not "supported", testing only
``ananll``   [policy?]      not "supported", testing only
``fra6gc``   `Travis CI`_   not "supported"
``fra6ll``   `Travis CI`_   not "supported"
``fri3gc``   none
``fri3ll``   none
``fri6gc``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no FreeBSD
``fri6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no FreeBSD
``lia6gc``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no arm64, not supported
``lia6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   GitHub has no arm64, not supported
``lii3gc``   none
``lii6gc``   `GitHub CI`_
``lii6ll``   `GitHub CI`_
``w3i3mv``   none
``w3i6mv``   `GitHub CI`_
``xca6ll``   `Cirrus CI`_   Cirrus has Tart
``xci6ll``   `GitHub CI`_
==========   ============   =====================================

_`.platform.supported`: The platforms here must be a superset of the platforms
listed as "supported" in readme.txt.

_`.platform.builds`: The platforms here must be a subset of the
platforms listed in "Building the MPS" manual/build.txt, but
preferably the same set so that CI covers all defined platforms.


Commands
--------

_`.run.posix`: On Posix systems where we have `autoconf
<https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>`_, the CI services run
commands equivalent to::

  ./configure
  make install
  make test

which execises the testci target, as defined by `Makefile.in
<../Makefile.in>`_ in the root of the MPS tree.

_`.run.windows`: On Windows the CI services run commands that do at
least::

  nmake /f w3i6mv.nmk all testci

as defined by the `.github.config`_.

_`.run.other.targets`: On some platforms we arrange to run the testansi,
testpollnone, testratio, and testscheme targets.  [Need to explain
why, where, etc.  RB 2023-01-15]

_`.run.manual`: The manual is built by Read the Docs which directly
invokes Sphinx, so there are no commands.

_`.run.other.checks`: We could also run various non-build checks
using CI to check:

- document formatting
- shell script syntax

[In the branch of writing, these do not yet exist.  They are the
subject of `GitHub pull request #113
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/pull/113>`_ of
branch/2023-01-13/rst-check.  When merged, they can be linked.  RB
2023-01-15]


Events
------

_`.when:`: CI is triggered on the `mps GitHub repo`_ by:

- commits (pushes)
- new pull requests
- manually, using `.tools`_

.. _mps GitHub repo: https://github.com/ravenbrook/mps


Results
-------

_`.results`: CI results are visible via the GitHub web interface:

- in pull requests, under "Checks",

- on the `branches page <https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/branches>`_
  as green ticks or red crosses that link to details.

as well as in logs specific to the type of CI.

_`.results.github`: Results from `GitHub CI`_ can be found at `build
and test actions on the Actions tab at the Ravenbrook GitHub repo
<https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml>`_.

_`.results.cirrus`: Results from `Cirrus CI`_ can be found at
`Ravenbrook/mps - Cirrus CI
<https://cirrus-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps>`_.

_`.results.travis`: Results from `Travis CI`_ can be found at `Travis
CI build history for the MPS GitHub repo
<https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Ravenbrook/mps/builds>`_.

_`.results.readthedocs`: Results from `Read the Docs`_ can be found at
`Builds | Read the Docs
<https://readthedocs.org/projects/memory-pool-system/builds/>`_.


Configuration
-------------

_`.github.config`: `GitHub CI`_ is configured using several
"workflows" in the `.github/workflows directory
<../.github/workflows/>`_ of the MPS tree:

- the `build-and-test.yml <../.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml>`_
  file runs build and test commands (`.run.posix`_ , `.run.windows`_).

- the `shell-script-check.yml
  <../.github/workflows/shell-script-check.yml>`_ file runs the
  lint checks on shell scripts

[Coming soon from a branch/2023-01-13/rst-check near you:

- the `rst-check.yml <../.github/workflows/shell-script-check.yml>`_
  file runs syntax checks on reStructuredText documents

RB 2023-02-09]

_`.cirrus.config`: `Cirrus CI`_ is configured using the `.cirrus.yml
<../.cirrus.yml>`_ file at top level of the MPS tree.

_`.travis.config`: `Travis CI`_ is configured using the `.travis.yml
<../.travis.yml>`_ file at top level of the MPS tree.


Administration
--------------

[FIXME: Insert links, instructions, and setups on the CI sites and in
the repo settings.  RB 2023-02-09]


Tools
-----

_`.tools`: The MPS tree contains some simple tools for managing CI
without the need to install whole packages such as the GitHub CLI or
Travis CI's Ruby gem.

_`.tools.kick`: `tool/github-ci-kick <../tool/github-ci-kick>`_ and
`tool/travis-ci-kick <../tool/travis-ci-kick>`_ both trigger CI builds
without the need to push a change or make a pull request in the `mps
GitHub repo`_.  In particular, they are useful for applying CI to work
that was pushed while CI was disabled, for whatever reason.

[FIXME: No cirrus-ci-kick?  Read the Docs kick?  RB 2023-02-09]
