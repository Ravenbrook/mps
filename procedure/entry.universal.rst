_`.scope`: These entry criteria are to be used for all reviews.  Our
aim is for failure to prevent entry.  In the meantime, failure of
these must be documented in the review record and entry prevention is
at the leader's discretion.

_`.author`: The author of the document agrees to the review.

_`.source-available`: The source documents are available in writing.

_`.source-approved`: The source documents will have exited review.
Failing this, they should be mini-reviewed and the fact noted.
Failing this, they should be marked as "UNREVIEWED".

_`.rules-available`: The relevant rules are available in writing.

_`.rules-approved`: The rule documents have exited review.  Failing
this, see .source-approved.

_`.brief-check`: The leader has performed a cursory examination and
has found no more than one major defect (see guide.review.class.major
[Needs importing and reference.  RB 2023-01-23]) per page.

_`.plan`: There is a procedure for the review, including checking
rates for this type of document.

_`.training`: The leader has been formally trained and certified in
Inspection.

_`.auto-check`: All automatic checks have been performed on the
product document, and it has passed.
