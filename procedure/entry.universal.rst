_`.scope`: These entry criteria are to be used for all reviews (see
`proc.review.entry.criteria`_).

_`.author`: The author_ of the document agrees to the review.

_`.reason`: The change must include, or permanently link to as a
`source`_, the reason the change is needed, expressed in terms of
requirements.

- On GitHub, this can be the GitHub issue linked via the pull request.

_`.source-available`: The `source documents`_ are available in
writing.  [What is the purpose of "in writing" here and how to express
it now?  RB 2023-01-24]

_`.source-approved`: The `source documents`_ will have `exited review`_.
Failing this, they should be mini-reviewed and the fact noted.
Failing this, they should be marked as "UNREVIEWED".

_`.rules-available`: The relevant rules are available in writing.

_`.rules-approved`: The rule documents have exited review.  Failing
this, see `.source-approved`_.

_`.brief-check`: The leader has performed a cursory examination and
has found no more than one major defect (see guide.review.class.major
[Needs importing and reference.  RB 2023-01-23]) per page.  [This
should go further up the list.  RB 2023-01-24]

_`.plan`: There is a procedure for the review, including checking
rates for this type of document.

_`.training`: The leader has been formally trained and certified in
Inspection.  [This is unrealistic in the public MPS.  What can we say?
RB 2023-01-24]

_`.auto-check`: All automatic checks have been performed on the
product document, and it has passed.  [What counts as "all"?  This
means all the ones that are implemented in the MPS, e.g.
``make test``, CI checks, checks in ``tool/*``, etc.  RB 2023-01-24]

B. Document History
-------------------

Full document history before to 2001 has been lost because this
document was maintained in "Spring", a Lotus Notes information system
at Harlequin Limited.  Ravenbrook Limited did not receive a full
revision history when it acquired the MPS from Harlequin's successor.
