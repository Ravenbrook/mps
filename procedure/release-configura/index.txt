How to make an MPS release for Configura.  

This document tells you how to make a new release of the MPS for Configura. 
It assumes that the source-code work (the reason for the new release) is in
master sources already.

Readership: MPS staff.  Confidential: no.  Status: rough notes, informally
peer-reviewed.  Author: RHSK.

Background: refer to PQTCM ("Product Quality Through Change Management",
<http://www.ravenbrook.com/doc/1999/05/20/pqtcm/>) for background,
terminology, rationale, and usage guidance.  This tells you what "a release"
actually is.

__OVERVIEW__

Steps:

1. (optional) make a new version: see <procedure/version-create/>

2. check the diffs: eg. "p4 diff2 -q version/1.105/... version/1.106/...".

3. get the equipment ready: see __EQUIPMENT__ below.

4. test the new code: see <code/tool/testrunner.py>

5. build the release: see __BUILD__ below.


__EQUIPMENT__

You need a Windows box.  I used a PC with P4, VisualC++, and cygwin on it
already.

Set-up a login and password if necessary.  To prevent pwd expiry, use Start >
Programs > Admin Tools > User Manager.  To make cmd windows tab-complete
filenames, do this:  Start > Run > regedit.  HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software >
Microsoft > Command Processor > CompletionChar = 9.

If you want to access remotely from a Mac, use "Chicken of the VNC", eg.
2.02b2.  You'll need the VNC session-password (not the same as your NT login
password).  Remember how to escape from Full-screen: Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-`
(backquote); and how to right-click: depress and release Shift-key, then
click.

To copy ad-hoc files (like build output) to and from a Mac, mount the PC's
disk on your Mac.  Finder > Go > Network > Network > Ravenbrook > PC.  Be
patient: list of servers may take some seconds to fully update/populate.  For
a machine in its own workgroup, it may be more like Finder > Go > Network >
Network > Workgroup > PC.  By default XP has "simple file-sharing", so if you
share the whole disk you still don't share stuff in Documents and Settings. 
To fix this: turn off "simple file-sharing" by clearing the check-box at
Control Panel > Folder Options > View > "Use simple file sharing
(Recommended)"; and go back to the share point (eg. C:\) > Properties >
Sharing > Permissions, and make it PC\Users who have access (not Everyone).

Start > Programs > P4Win.  Set-up a P4 client.  Set-up the client map.  P4sync
to check it's working.

Or, for command-line p4, first need to do "p4 set" to set P4USER, P4CLIENT,
and P4PORT (eg. "p4 set P4USER=rhsk").  This sets things in the registry, so
it is persistent.


__BUILD__

Read all of
<http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>,
which is the normal release-build procedure.  Keeping referring to it during
this procedure.  The following notes are just a delta from it.

First, clean out the place code will be built in, and sync to the right
changelevel (the changelevel you have decided is going to be the release's
origin), by using the following procedure:

    # (you may wish to check for opened files first)
    p4 revert version/VERSION/...
    rm -rf version/VERSION
    p4 sync -f version/VERSION/...@CHANGELEVEL

(Note: "revert" and "sync -f" are required: otherwise p4-opened or
forced-writeable files may remain or be omitted).

cd code

You may need to do "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32.bat".  (This also sets up the path so you can just
type "nmake").

Invoke w3build.

(
you might think that "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio\VC98\Bin\nmake.exe" /f w3i3mv.nmk is right, but no, you want: 
//info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/code/w3build.bat
)

This makes a release directory called "rel-1_108_0" or some such, eg:
duck:/Volumes/PC-C/rhsk/master/code/rel-1_108_0 richardk$ find . '-type' d '-print'
.
./include
./lib
./lib/w3i3
./lib/w3i3/ce
./lib/w3i3/ci
./lib/w3i3/we
./lib/w3i3/wi
./src

Make a tar archive of the release directory.  (PC needs cygwin, which includes
GNU tar, etc.).  Use this command:
  "tar cfz MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.tgz rel-1_108_0"
A.BBB.C is the release name.  DDDDDD is the release origin changelevel.  

*Also*, make a _zip_ archive of the release directory.  (PC needs Info-ZIP.). 
Use this command:
  "zip -r MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.zip rel-1_108_0"
A.BBB.C is the release name.  DDDDDD is the release origin changelevel.  

p4 add both archives under mps/release.  (This is your first candidate build
for release A.BBB.C).

Test the zip one.  (Copy to new place and extract with "unzip
MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.zip".  Consider using tool/test-runner.py to run
various tests, repeatedly.)

(If you want to to test the tgz too: copy to new place and extract with "tar
xfz MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.tgz"; note: do not use auto-complete on the tgz
filename, because a full pathname confuses tar.  Consider using
tool/test-runner.py to run various tests, repeatedly.)

Once successfully tested, update infosys.  See
<http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>. 
Remember to update issue.cgi.

Make sure it is sync'd to www.ravenbrook.com.  (As of 2007, this should happen
automatically every minute).  Then send an email with a pointer to the
release.

(You could also send it attached to a separate email.  But this is NOT
reliable: it may get stuck in a virus filter.)

END OF PROCEDURE


DOCUMENT HISTORY

2005-10-03  RHSK  Created.
2006-12-27  RHSK  Minor tweaks: drop incorrect release origin comment; www auto-syncs now.
2007-07-05  RHSK  Use zip; GR prefers it.  w3build.bat makes dir called rel-1_108_0.
2009-09-22  RHSK  word wrap
