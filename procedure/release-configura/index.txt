How to make an MPS release for Configura.  

This document tells you how to make a new release of the MPS for Configura.  It assumes that the source-code work (the reason for the new release) is in master sources already.  

Readership: MPS staff.  Confidential: no.  Status: rough notes, informally peer-reviewed.  Author: RHSK.

Background: refer to PQTCM ("Product Quality Through Change Management", <http://www.ravenbrook.com/doc/1999/05/20/pqtcm/>) for background, terminology, rationale, and usage guidance.  This tells you what "a release" actually is.

__OVERVIEW__

Steps:

1. (optional) make a new version: see <procedure/version-create/>

2. check the diffs: eg. "p4 diff2 -q version/1.105/... version/1.106/...".

3. get the tools ready: see __TOOLS__ below.

4. test the new code: see <code/tool/testrunner.py>

5. build the release: see __BUILD__ below.


__TOOLS__

You need a Windows box.  I used sandpiper, which has P4, VisualC++, and cygwin on it already.  

Set-up a login and password if necessary.  To prevent pwd expiry, use Start > Programs > Admin Tools > User Manager.  To make cmd windows tab-complete filenames, do this:  Start > Run > regedit.  HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Microsoft > Command Processor > CompletionChar = 9.  

If you want to access remotely from a Mac, use "Chicken of the VNC", eg. 2.02b2.  You'll need the VNC session-password (not the same as your NT login password).  Remember how to escape from Full-screen: Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-` (backquote); and how to right-click: depress and release Shift-key, then click.  

To copy ad-hoc files (like build output) to and from a Mac, mount sandpiper's disk on your Mac.  Finder > Go > Network > Network > Ravenbrook > Sandpiper.  Be patient: list of servers may take some seconds to fully update/populate.  

Start > Programs > P4Win.  Set-up a P4 client (rhsk-sandpiper).  It should be using port 1666.  There is no need to ssh / tunnel, because sandpiper is on the Ravenbrook ethernet.  Set-up the client map.  P4sync to check it's working.  

Or, for command-line p4, first need to do "p4 set" to set P4USER, P4CLIENT, and P4PORT (eg. "p4 set P4USER=rhsk").  This sets things in the registry, so it is persistent.  


__BUILD__

Read all of <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>, which is the normal release-build procedure.  Keeping referring to it during this procedure.  The following notes are just a delta from it.  

First, clean out the place code will be built in, and sync to the right changelevel (the changelevel you have decided is going to be the release's origin).  

cd code

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32.bat".  (This also sets up the path so you can just type "nmake").  

Invoke w3build.

(
you might think that "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\nmake.exe" /f w3i3mv.nmk
is right, but no, you want:  //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/code/w3build.bat
)

This makes a release directory, eg:
duck:/Volumes/SANDPIPER-C/rhsk/master/code/release richardk$ find . '-type' d '-print'
.
./include
./lib
./lib/w3i3
./lib/w3i3/ce
./lib/w3i3/ci
./lib/w3i3/we
./lib/w3i3/wi
./src

Make a tar archive of the release directory.  (Sandpiper has cygwin, which includes GNU tar, etc.).  Use this command:
  "tar cfz MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.tgz release"
A.BBB.C is the release name.  DDDDDD is the release origin changelevel (which, for release A.BBB.0, is usually the changelevel of the integrate that first populated the version branch with files).  

p4 add this under mps/release.  (It's your first candidate build for release A.BBB.C).  

Test it.  (Copy to new place and extract with "tar xvf MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.tgz").  

Once successfully tested, update infosys.  See <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>.  Remember to update issue.cgi.  

Make sure it is sync'd to www.ravenbrook.com.  NB knows magic to do this.  [RHSK notes: needs a procedure].  Then send an email with a pointer to the release.  

(You could also, separately, email it as an attachment.  But this is NOT reliable: it may get stuck in a virus filter.)
