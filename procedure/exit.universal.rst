_`.scope`: These exit criteria should be used for all reviews (see
`proc.review.exit.criteria`_).

.. _`proc.review.exit.criteria`: review.rst#58-review-exit

_`.edit`: The editor has taken written action on all issues, recorded
in the review record; these may include rejecting the issue.

_`.quest`: All questions to the author (q) should have been answered
in mail to mm, and possibly in documentation.  ["Mail to mm" is
specific to the Harlequin MM Group.  GitHub comment responses are now
sufficient.  RB 2023-01-24]
 
_`.imp`: All improvement suggestions (I) should have resulted in one
of the following:

- _`.imp.edit`: Edit of another document; not if it is already
  approved.

- _`.imp.mail`: Passed on to someone responsible for the other
  document, and accepted.

- _`.imp.issue`: Escalated to an InfoSys issue.  ["InfoSys issue" is
  specific to the Harlequin MM Group or Ravenbrook.  GitHub issues are
  now sufficient.  RB 2023-01-24]

- _`.imp.reject`: Rejected by the editor for a documented reason.

_`.record`: All fields have been filled in in the review record,
including metrics, and estimated defects remaining.

_`.defects`: The estimated defects remaining is less than the
acceptable level for the document type.  In the absence of a more
specific level, use 2 major defects (see guide.review.class.major
[Needs importing and referencing.  RB 2023-01-23]) per page.

_`.rates`: The checking and logging rates did not exceed the optimum
rates by more that 20% on average. [Being too slow is ok.]

_`.veto.author`: The author does not wish to veto exit.

_`.veto.leader`: The leader does not wish to veto exit.

B. Document History
-------------------

Full document history before to 2001 has been lost because this
document was maintained in "Spring", a Lotus Notes information system
at Harlequin Limited.  Ravenbrook Limited did not receive a full
revision history when it acquired the MPS from Harlequin's successor.
