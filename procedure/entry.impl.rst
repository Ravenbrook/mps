_`.scope`: These are additional entry criteria for the review of code.
See entry.universal.

_`.author`: In the case of code there is often not a clear author.  In
this case, the leader may select one or more people who have edited
the file recently, at his discretion.

_`.auto-check`: Source code should compile without errors.  Lint
should have been run where available.
