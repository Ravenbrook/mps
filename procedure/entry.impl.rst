_`.scope`: These entry criteria are to be used for reviews of code
(see `proc.review.entry.criteria`_).

.. _`proc.review.entry.criteria`: review.rst#51-review-entry.

_`.author`: In the case of code there is often not a clear author.  In
this case, the leader may select one or more people who have edited
the file recently, at their discretion.

should have been run where available.

document was maintained in "Spring", a Lotus Notes information system
at Harlequin Limited.  Ravenbrook Limited did not receive a full
