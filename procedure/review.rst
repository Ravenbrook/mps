   "change", "work", "product document", etc.

.. TODO: Check against book.gilb93.proc.* and consider dividing
   procedures by role.

1. Introduction
===============

This is the procedure for reviewing a change to the MPS in order to
prevent defects (`.purpose`_).

This procedure may seem overwhelming at first, but it can be executed
quickly [how quickly? kpa.qpm! RB 2023-01-21] once you have learned it
[and how long does that take?  RB 2023-01-21].  [Insert example times
here for different kinds of work.  RB 2023-01-21]

[Insert time-to-execute estimates here based on measurements during
testing of this procedure.  RB 2023-01-23.]

This procedure requires *training*, preferably by an experienced
review leader (`.role.leader`_).  At the very least, do not apply this
procedure to risky changes without first:

- reading and understanding the whole document and the related rules

- practising it on low-risk changes

This is a placeholder while we arrange to bring in documents from
outside the MPS Git repository and tree.  For background, see `GitHub
issue #95 <https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/issues/95>`_.

Since this document was created as part of `a project to migrate from
Perforce to Git (and GitHub)
<https://github.com/orgs/Ravenbrook/projects/1>`_, this procedure will
give specifics on conducting review via GitHub.  But the process is in
no way specific to GitHub, Git, Perforce, or any other tool.

This procedure was created by incorporating and updating review
process documents from Ravenbrook and the Harlequin MM Group (see
`A. References`_).  Those documents contain process improvements from
hundreds of reviews and thousands of hours of effort.

The process is largely derived from "Software Inspection" [Gilb_93]_.
It was developed over years by Gavin Matthews of the Harlequin Memory
Management Group, who was eventually trained in the art.

The process is an example of "Peer Review" (kpa.pr), a key process
area of level 3 of the Capability Maturity Model [CMU/SEI-93-TR-025]_,
but also contributes a great deal to:

- Defect Prevention (kpa.dp, level 5)
- Process Change Management (kpa.pcm, level 5)
- Quantitive Process Management (kpa.qpm, level 4)

[Notes for inclusion:
  - Review is not just (or even mostly) looking at diffs, though
    GitHub encourages this idea.
  - Review is not just for code.
  - Check against book.gilb93.handbook [Gilb_93]_.
  - Check against kpa.pr, [CMU/SEI-93-TR-025]_, p L3-97
  - Review is about humans and mind tricks.]


2. Purpose
==========

_`.purpose`: The purpose of the review procedure is:

1. _`.goal.fix`: find and correct `major defects`_

2. _`.goal.prevent`: prevent future defects

[What about getting required changes in to the MPS?  Review is not
purely obstructive.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.def.defect`: A defect is a way in which the work does not meet its
requirements.

_`.def.defect.major`: A major defect is a defect that

  will probably have significantly increased costs to find and fix
  later in the development process, for example in testing or in use.

  -- `.class.major`_

As with any procedure, you can vary this one to meet this purpose, but
you should probably read section `11. Rationale`_.


3. Review Roles
===============

_`.role`: People taking part in review are given *roles*.

_`.role.two`: All the roles can be covered by just two people.

_`.role.all`: The leader (`.role.leader`_) must ensure that all roles
are assigned to someone, to ensure that everything necessary gets
done.

_`.role.everyone`: Every person taking part in review should be assigned at
least one role, to make it clear what they need to do.

_`.role.leader`: The *leader* organises and plans the review, and
ensures the procedures are executed.  The leader is responsible for
managing the process in all respects for productive results.  The
author (`.role.author`_) can lead, but this should be avoided if not
an experienced leader.  It is helpful if the leader has received
special instruction in review or inspection.

_`.role.author`: The *author* is the person responsible for the change
under review (`.doc.product`_).  For example, they're the developer
who submitted a pull request.

_`.role.checker`: A *checker* checks the change during review.  There
must be more than one checker.  Every person taking part in a review
is usually also a checker, including the author.  Checkers should be
asked by the leader to check with certain *checking roles*
(`.role.check`_) in mind; this is to increase coverage and reduce
duplication of issues.  Checkers also take part defect prevention in
`.phase.brainstorm`_.

_`.role.editor`: The *editor* is the person responsible for acting on
the issues found during review in order to bring the work to review
exit.  The editor and `.role.author`_ are usually the same person.
For example, they're the developer who submitted a pull request and
needs to fix it up before it can be merged.

_`.role.improver`: The *process improver* takes action to prevent
future occurences of defects found by review.  This should be the same
person as `.role.editor`_ so that they maintain a good understanding
of (and commitment to) process improvement and defect prevention, but
this isn't always possible, e.g. when `.role.author`_ is an outside
contributor.

_`.role.scribe`: The scribe is the person who records information (not
just issues) during review meetings.  They are usually the same person
as `.role.leader`_.  During `.phase.check`_, review tools (such as
GitHub) will often allow checkers to record issues as they check, in
which case the scribe should just ensure that this has been done.  The
scribe also records information during other phases, such as how much
time a review took, who was there, who did what, etc.  [Make sure
necessary information to record is documented in this procedure under
a uniform tag.  RB 2023-01-23]

[The following two roles may not be relevant to this section.  They do
not need to be assigned during a review.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.role.chief`: [Chief Inspection Leader in book.gilb93.  Need to look
this up.  Probably an organizational role to do with communicating
improvements to the review process.  Not relevant to the MPS.  RB
2023-01-20]

_`.role.manager`: The *manager* ensures adequate resources are
assigned to review and that reviews are happening.  [Project Manager
in book.gilb93.  Need to look this up.  Probably not required to
attend the review, and therefore is not assigned. RB 2023-01-20]


4. Phases
=========

_`.phase`: This section describes the phases of a review.  Each phase
has a procedure.  The phases involve varying groups of people
(`.role`_) and have diverse purposes.

_`.phase.handbook`: This section can be used as a short "handbook" for
people who have learned the procedure.  (Compare with "A one-page
inspection handbook" [Gilb_93]_.)

_`.phase.order`: To review a change, the following procedures are
executed roughly in the order below.

#. _`.phase.request`: `.role.author`_ requests that their change be
   reviewed.  For example, they submit a GitHub pull request, or
   update the pull request state from "draft" to "ready to review".

#. _`.phase.entry`: `.role.leader`_ executes `.entry`_.  If the change
   doesn't meet the entry criteria then the change fails review, and
   the rest of the review process is not executed.  A `.role.author`_
   who is an experienced `.role.leader`_ can do entry on their own
   work.

#. _`.phase.planning`: `.role.leader`_ executes `.planning`_ to
   prepare the review and arrange for it to happen.

#. _`.phase.kickoff`: `.role.leader`_ and `.role.checker`_ execute
   `.ko`_, beginning the review.

#. _`.phase.check`: `.role.checker`_ individually execute `.check`_,
   according to their checking roles (`.role.check`_), looking for
   unique `major defects`_ that no other checker will bring to the
   logging meeting.  Checking continues during the next phase,
   `.phase.log`_.

#. _`.phase.log`: `.role.leader`_, `.role.scribe`_, and
   `.role.checker`_ together execute `.log`_ to share and record what
   has been found, and to find more `major defects`_, stimulated by
   what has been found so far.  `.phase.check`_ continues during this
   phase.

#. _`.phase.brainstorm`: `.role.leader`_, `.role.scribe`_, and
   `.role.checker`_, execute `.brainstorm`_ to come up with ways of
   preventing defects in future.

#. _`.phase.estimation`: `.role.leader`_, `.role.scribe`_, and
   `.role.checker`_ spend a few minutes using `.calc`_ to estimate how
   productive the review was, by:

   - estimating the cost of the review (mostly work hours)
   - projecting what the defects would cost if uncorrected
   - projecting what similar defects would cost if not prevented

   and `.role.scribe`_ records this information.

#. _`.phase.edit`: `.role.editor`_ executes `.edit`_, analysing and
   correcting defects, but taking *some* action on *every* issue.

#. _`.phase.pi`: `.role.improver`_ executes `.pi`_ to prevent `major
   defects`_ by correcting *causes*.

#. _`.phase.exit`: `.role.editor`_ and `.role.leader`_ perform
   `.exit`_.  If the revised change does not meet the exit criteria
   then it fails review.  Otherwise it passes and can go on to be
   used, e.g. by being merged into the master codeline
   (`proc.merge.pull-request`_).

.. _proc.merge.pull-request: pull-request-merge.rst

.. _major defects: `.def.defect.major`_


5. Procedures
=============

5.1. Review Entry
-----------------

_`.entry`: The *review entry procedure* should be executed when a
change is submitted for review (`.phase.entry`_).  The purpose of
entry is to check whether the change is ready for review before
planning a review, committing resources, organizing meetings, etc.

_`.entry.record`: Record the entry procedure (`.doc.record`_).

- On GitHub, you can start a comment on the pull request.

- Record a the procedure you're following (this one).  Use a
  permalink.  For example::

    Executing [review entry](https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/blob/d4ef690a7f2a3d3d6d0ed496eff46e09841b8633/procedure/review.rst#51-review-entry)

_`.entry.change`: Record exactly what the change is.

- On GitHub, this information is implicitly recorded by commenting on
  the pull request in `.entry.record`_.

- Otherwise, record something like the branch name and commit hash.
  [Note: Git fails at this because merged branches forget their branch
  points.  We need some way to fix that.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.entry.criteria`: Determine and record the entry and exit criteria.

- `entry.universal`_ and `exit.universal`_ always apply.

- Add criteria for the types of documents altered by the change (code,
  design, etc.) from the `procedure directory`_.

- Record permalinks to the criteria.  For example::

    Executing [review entry](https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/blob/d4ef690a7f2a3d3d6d0ed496eff46e09841b8633/procedure/review.rst#51-review-entry)

    - Applying [entry.universal](https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/blob/eceaccdf5ab8d8614e9a8bb91a23bdcb99e7d0ce/procedure/entry.universal.rst) and [entry.impl](https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/blob/eceaccdf5ab8d8614e9a8bb91a23bdcb99e7d0ce/procedure/entry.impl.rst).  

_`.entry.check`: Check that the entry criteria hold.  Record any
transgressions.  Decide whether to reject the change from review by
balancing `2. Purpose`_ and cost.

.. _entry.universal: entry.universal.rst

.. _exit.universal: exit.universal.rst

.. _procedure directory: ./


5.2. Review Planning
--------------------

_`.planning`: The *review planning procedure* should be executed when
a change has passed `.entry`_.  The purpose of planning is to prepare
the review and arrange for it to happen.

_`.plan.record`: Create a record for the procedure.  On GitHub, you
can start a comment on the pull request.  Record a *permalink* to the
procedure you're following (this one) like::

  Executing [review planning](https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/blob/d4ef690a7f2a3d3d6d0ed496eff46e09841b8633/procedure/review.rst#52-review-planning)

_`.plan.time`: Estimate the checking rate and time.  A single review
should not have a checking time of more than one hour.  Record your
estimate.  [Insert example GitHub comment.]

_`.plan.schedule`: Plan when this review may take place and who should
attend.  Check with attendees if appropriate.  Record like::

  @thejayps and @UNAA008 will review 2023-01-23 11:00 for about 2h.

_`.plan.source`: Determine and record the source documents
(`.doc.source`_).  This *must* include the the reason the change is
needed in terms of requirements.  [Entry should've ensured this.  RB
2023-01-23]  On GitHub, this can be the GitHub issue linked from the
pull request.

_`.plan.rule`: Determine and record the rules to apply (`.doc.rule`_).
You can use the entry criteria recorded by `.entry.criteria`_ to
select rule sets [from where?  RB 2023-01-23], but also consider the
list of rule sets [where? RB 2023-01-23].  [We might want e.g. rules
that apply to the critical path.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.plan.check`: Determine and record the checklists to apply [how and
from where?  RB 2023-01-23].

_`.plan.roles`: Determine and record the checking roles
(`.role.check`_) to assign [how?  RB 2023-01-23].  [The leader and
scribe will be somewhat occupied during logging.  RB 2023-01-23]
[Always try to assign the backwards role.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.plan.invite`: Invite the checkers (`.role.checker`_) to the kickoff
meeting (`.ko`_).


5.3. Review Kickoff
-------------------

[Sourced from [MM_proc.review.ko]_ and needs updating.  RB 2023-01-21]

_`.ko`: `.role.leader`_ holds the *review kickoff* meeting to ensure
that the review begins, and that everyone involved has what they need
to carry out their roles.


5.3.1. In Advance
.................

[This section could be moved to the planning phase.  RB 2023-01-21]

_`.ko.doc.prep`: In advance of the meeting, the leader ensures that checkers have 
access to the necessary documents, either by supplying them with physical 
copies, or by advising them of the documents in advance.

_`.ko.train.prep`: If any checkers are not familiar with formal review, the leader 
should ensure that they are briefed, and supplied with the relevant process 
documents.


5.3.2. At The Meeting
.....................

_`.ko.record`: Times, objectives, and anything else appropriate should all be 
recorded in the review record.

_`.ko.doc.check`: In the meeting, the leader checks that all checkers have access to 
all necessary documents.

_`.ko.intro`: The leader may ask the author to prepare a short (one minute) 
introduction to the product document.

_`.ko.role`: The leader announces or negotiates any checking roles
(`.role.check`_) they wish to assign, and ensures that checkers
understand their assignments.

_`.ko.improve`: The leader announces any relevant metrics and negotiates objectives.

[How about asking people for suggestions or experiments?  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.ko.log`: The leader announces the time of the logging meeting.  This should 
normally be set at the estimate end of the kickoff meeting, plus the estimated 
checking time, plus a short tea-break.  It should not normally be delayed to 
another day.

_`.ko.remind`: The leader reminds checkers of the purpose of review
(see `2. Purpose`_).

_`.ko.author`: The leader reminds the author that they can withdraw the
document from review at any time.

_`.ko.train.check`: The leader checks that checkers are familiar with their tasks and 
solicits any questions or suggestions.


5.4. Review Checking
--------------------

[Sourced from [MM_proc.review.check]_ and needs updating.  RB 2023-01-21]

_`.check`: The *checking procedure* should be executed by each
individual `.role.checker`_ alone, carrying out their assigned
checking roles (`.role.check`_) without conferring with other
checkers.  The purpose of checking is to find `major defects`_ not
found by other checkers.

[Note: not all issues are local to a line.  RB 2023-01-21]

[This text was in the phase section and might need to be incorporated here:

   The checking phase has a recommended time or rate, but checkers
   have instructions to deviate from that whenever individual
   availability, role, or situation dictates, in order to increase
   productivity.

   The objective of individual checking is to identify a maximum of
   unique major issues which no other checker will bring to the
   logging meeting.  To do this each checker should have at least one
   special "checking role".

RB 2023-01-23]


5.4.1. Start
............

_`.check.doc`: Ensure that you have all the relevant documents.

_`.check.ask`: Ask the review leader if you have any questions about
checking procedure.


5.4.2. Checking
...............

_`.check.source`: First, read any source documents.  Review is not
directed at finding defects in source documents, but any found are a
bonus.  They will be improvement suggestions (see class.imp [To what
does this refer?  RB 2023-01-21]).  Do not waste too much time finding
defects in source documents.

_`.check.rule`: Ensure that you are familiar with all rule sets or
check lists.

_`.check.role`: Ensure that you know and keep in mind the roles you
have been assigned.

_`.check.product`: Read through the product document (or documents) in
the order specified.  Remember to read the product documents in
reverse order if you were assigned `.role.check.backwards`_ during
`.ko.role`_.

_`.check.major`: Concentrate on finding `major defects`_; this is of
primary importance.

_`.check.max`: Find as many issues as possible to help the author.

_`.check.note`: Note all issues; you need not log them later.

_`.check.rough`: Your log can be rough; concentrate on finding issues.

_`.check.trouble`: Consult the leader if you have any questions, or if
you are finding too many or too few issues.

_`.check.class`: Classify each issue you find according to `.class`_.


5.4.3. End
..........

_`.check.record`: At the end of checking, record (for each product
document):

- How many defects were found, by class (see `.check.class`_);

- How long was actually spent;

- How much of the product document was actually checked;

- Any problems encountered.


5.5. Review Logging
-------------------

[Sourced from [MM_proc.review.log]_ and needs updating.  RB 2023-01-21]

_`.log`: The *review logging procedure* executed by `.role.leader`_
and `.role.scribe`_ together with `.role.checker`_.  It has two
purposes:

1. to record issues for action

2. to find more `major defects`_ by sharing what has been found so far.

Checking continues during logging.

_`.log.just`: The main reason for having joint logging sessions is so
that new issues are found.

[This text was in the phase section and may need incorporating here.

   The team concentrates on logging items at a rate of at least one
   per minute.  Items logged include potential defects (issues),
   improvement suggestions, and questions of intent to the author.
   The leader permits little other verbal meeting activity.  Meetings
   last as maximum of two hours at the known optimum rate.  If
   necessary, work must be chunked to avoid tiredness.  Optimum
   checking rate for the meeting is determined by the percentage of
   new issues identified in the logging meeting as well as the
   quantity of the documents.

RB 2023-01-23]


5.5.1. Advice for the author
............................

[Imported from mminfo:book.gilb93.proc.author.logging.  RB 2023-01-26]

- Report your own noted issues after giving your team-mates a chance.

- Don't say 'I found that too!'

- Thank your colleagues for their efforts on your behalf.

- Learn as much as possible about avoiding the issues as an author.

- Respect the opinion of your team-mates.  Do not justify or defend.

- Check the logging for legibility and intelligibility.

- Answer any 'questions of intent' logged by checkers at the end of
  the logging meeting.


5.5.2. During The Meeting
.........................

_`.log.record`: All information gathered should be recorded in the
review log.  This may be deferred if the meeting is mediated by a
logged medium, such as IRC.

_`.log.metrics`: Gather individual metrics of:

- Issue counts by class;

- Time spent checking;

- Amount of product document actually checked.

_`.log.author`: The leader reminds the author that he may remove
documents from review at any time.

_`.log.decide`: The leader, in consultation with the author and
editor, decides whether it is worth holding continuing with the
logging meeting.  [Using what criteria?  We've never actually done
this.  GavinM 1997-06-12] In particular, see exit.universal.rates [To
what does this refer?  RB 2023-01-21].  [It could be that many or very
serious issues are logged very early in the meeting, and so the work
needs major revision and a new review later.  But there's a risk that
issues won't be found in a second review, which is why we never
cancelled.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.log.scribe`: Assign a scribe (usually the leader), and ensure the
editor will be happy with the readability of the log.

_`.log.explain`: The leader explains the order in which issues will be
logged, and ensures everyone understand this.  He also explains the
desired form of issues, namely:

- Location;

- `.class`_, including `.class.new`_ (N) if the issue was discovered
  during logging;

- Description of issue, concentrating on how it breaks a rule, rather
  than on possible solutions, naming the rule or checklist question,
  if possible.

_`.log.dup`: The leader should also explain that checkers should avoid
logging issues that have are duplicates of ones already logged, ut
that if in doubt, they should log.

_`.log.slow`: Issues are logged sufficienly slowly that all checkers
can examine each issue.  This is so that checkers can find new issues.

_`.log.order`: Unless instructed otherwise, checkers should try to
list their issues in forwards document order.  This makes life easier
for other checkers and the editor.

_`.log.fast`: Logging should more fairly brisky, however, and the
leader should be firm in discouraging discussion of:

- Whether issues are genuine defects;

- How a defect may be resolved;

- The review process (other than to answer questions);

- The answers to questions logged.

[And encouraging the search for more defects, see `.log.just`_.
RB 2023-01-21]

[ There has been much experimentation with the order of logging, but
this represents current best practice.  GavinM 1997-06-12 ]

_`.log.major`: The leader calls upon all checkers, one by one, to list
their `major defects`_, preferable in order of their occurance in the
product document.  He may chunk the product document and go round the
checkers several times, but this is unusal.

_`.log.decide.non-major`: The leader may decide not to log all minor
issues (`.class.minor`_).  He should announce that each
checker should offer some number, or fraction.  Other issues may be
logged in writing.

_`.log.non-major`: The leader takes all checkers through the product
document in order, at each stage:

- Announcing the section being looked at;

- Asking who has issues in this section;

- Requesting issues from checkers.  [This may be unnecessary if using
  an asynchronous medium, such as IRC.  GavinM 1997-06-12]

Note that improvement suggestions arising from specific parts of the
product document can be logged at this stage.

_`.log.general`: The leader then requests, by checker, any general or
new issues not already logged.

_`.log.brainstorm`: The leader negotiates a time for the process
brainstorm.  This will normally be a tea-break (10-15 minutes) after
the end of the logging meeting.


5.5.3. After The Meeting
........................

_`.log.inform`: The reviewed document is now ready for edit (see proc.review.edit).  
The review leader should inform the editor of this by mail.


5.6. Review Brainstorm
----------------------

[Sourced from [MM_proc.review.brainstorm]_ and needs updating.  RB
2023-01-21]

_`.brainstorm`: The *review brainstorm procedure* should be executed
by `.role.leader`_, `.role.scribe`_, and `.role.checker`_ right after
`.log`_.  The purpose is to come up with ways of preventing defects in
future.  The meeting should *not* analyse the defects found by the
review, or suggest ways to fix those defects, except insofar as it is
necessary to develop ways to *prevent* those defects.

_`.brainstorm.just`: The purpose of holding a process brainstorm
meeting is to meet the second goal of review (`.goal.prevent`_) by
finding ways to prevent the reoccurance of defects.  This closes the
process improvement loop.

[This text was in the phase section and may need incorporating here.

   The followup is done by the `.role.leader`_, and make take place any
   time after the brainstorm meeting.  [What is the followup?  RB
   2023-01-20]

   Immediately after each logging meeting time is used to brainstorm
   the process causes of major defects, and to brainstorm improvements
   to remove these causes.  The meeting shall last no more than half
   an hour.  The objective is to maximize production of useful ideas
   and personal commitment to change within that time.

RB 2023-01-23]


5.6.1. In Advance
.................

_`.brainstorm.choose`: The leader chooses 3-6 major defects or groups
of `major defects`_ found in review.  They makes this choice based on
their importance and his own experience of which defects can be most
profitably attacked.


5.6.2. In The Meeting
.....................

_`.brainstorm.time`: The process brainstorm should last no more than
around 30 minutes.

_`.brainstorm.record`: The brainstorm should be recorded in the review
log as best as the scribe may.  This may be deferred if the process
brainstorm takes place by some logged medium, such as IRC.

_`.brainstorm.remind`: The leader reminds participants that their
purpose is to find process improvements that would have prevented
major defects from occurring.

_`.brainstorm.raise`: The leader raises each issue in turn, reminding
participants of the issue, and asking how it happenned and what could
have prevented it.

_`.brainstorm.disc`: The participants should discuss each defect for
no more than about five minutes.  They should focus on how the defect
arose, and what improvement could prevent it.  The leader should be
firm in curtailing discussion of how the defect can be fixed.

_`.brainstorm.proc`: If time permits, the leader may solicit
criticisms of the review process and apply `.brainstorm.disc`_ to
them.


5.6.3. After The Meeting
........................

_`.brainstorm.act`: The review leader should derive requests and
solution suggestions for the process product from the record, and
should note these in the review record where appropriate.  [This needs
to be made more specific.  RB 2023-01-21]


5.7. Review Edit
----------------

[Sourced from [MM_guide.review.edit]_ and needs updating.  RB 2023-01-21]

_`.edit`: The *review edit procedure* must be executed by
`.role.editor`_ to analyse and correct defects, the review's primary
purpose (`.goal.fix`_).

[This text was in the phase section, and may need incorporating here.

   Issue analysis and correction action is undertaken by an editor.
   Some written action must be taken on all logged issues -- if
   necessary by sending change requests to other authors.  The editor
   makes the final classification of issues into defects, and reports
   final defect metrics to the leader.  Edit also deals with
   improvements and can deal with "questions to the author".

RB 2023-01-23]

_`.edit.log`: The log should be placed in the edit section of the
review document.  The review document for a document of tag <tag> and
revision <revision> will be review.<tag>.<revision>.

_`.edit.order`: The log should be in numerical order, one issue per line.

_`.edit.extra`: You may make corrections to defects which you spot
yourself during editing work.  Log them like those found during
`.check`_ or `.log`_ and inform `.role.leader`_ about them.


5.7.1. Edit comments
....................

_`.edit.edit-comments`: The following describes the format of edit
comments for each issue, indicating the action taken.  See `.class`_
for issue classification.

_`.edit.record`: [Insert details of how to record edits.  RB
2023-01-23]


Major Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_`.edit.major`: Major issues should receive one of the following
responses:

_`.edit.major.reject`: "Reject: <reason>"

  reject the issue with a reason why it is not a valid issue.

_`.edit.major.comment`: "Comment: <reason>"

  it is a valid issue, but merely add a comment to the document, the
  reason states why it cannot be fixed at this time.  Note that this
  is not the same as fixing a defect in a comment.

_`.edit.major.fix`: "Fix: <detail>"

  fix the defect and give some indication of how.

_`.edit.major.raise`: "Raise: <tag>"

  escalate the defect, usually by creating a request in MM Evolution.

_`.edit.major.other`: If a major defect results in a change to another document, that 
document's tag must be quoted.


Minor Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_`.edit.minor`: Minor issues should receive one of the following
responses:

_`.edit.minor.reject`: "Reject: <reason>"

  reject is issue with a reason why it is  not a valid issue.

_`.edit.minor.forget`: "Forget: <reason>"

  it is a valid issue but is not worth taking any action over.
  [Should we have this?]

_`.edit.minor.comment`: "Comment: <reason>"

  it is a valid issue, but merely add a comment to the document, the
  reason states why it cannot be fixed at this time.  Note that this
  is not the same as fixing a defect in a comment.

_`.edit.minor.fix`: "Fix: <detail>"

  fix the defect and give an indication of how; the detail is optional
  where the fix is obvious.

_`.edit.minor.raise`: "Raise: <tag>"

  escalate the defect, usually by creating a request in MM Evolution.

_`.edit.minor.other`: If a minor defect results in a change to another document, that 
document's tag must be quoted.


Comments
~~~~~~~~

_`.edit.comment`: Comments on the product document should receive one of the following 
responses:

_`.edit.comment.reject`: "Reject: <reason>"

  reject the comment with a reason why it is invalid.

_`.edit.comment.forget`: "Forget: <reason>"

  it is a valid comment, but isn't worth taking any action over.  The
  reason is optional.

_`.edit.comment.comment`: "Comment: <detail>"

  a comment has been added to the document.  The detail is optional.

_`.edit.comment.fix`: "Fix: <detail>"

  the comment has resulted in a change to the product document.

_`.edit.comment.other`: If a comment results in a change to another
document, that document's tag must be quoted.


Questions To The Author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_`.edit.question`: Questions to the author should receive one of the following 
responses:

_`.edit.question.mail`: "Mail: <tag>.."

  the question is answered in the specified mail message(s).

_`.edit.question.raise`: "Raise: <tag>"

  the question has been escalated to the specified document, usually a
  request in MM Evolution.


Improvement Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_`.edit.improve`: Improvement suggestions should be left for `.pi`_,
unless you are also `.role.improver`_.


5.8. Process Improvement
------------------------

_`.pi`: The *process improvement procedure* must be executed by
`.role.improver`_ to take action to prevent future defects, the
review's secondary purpose (`.goal.prevent`_).

_`.pi.scope`: The scope of actions that might be taken by the improver
should not be limited, and could include:

- filing process issues for later action
- raising concerns with management
- sending suggestions to anyone
- suggesting wholesale review of working practices
- requesting training for staff.

as well as changes like:

- adding rules or checklist items
- updating procedures
- creating tools
- adding automated checks

_`.pi.record`: [Insert details of how to record PI actions.  RB
2023-01-23]

_`.pi.log`: The log should be placed in the process improvement
section of the review document.  [Needs updating.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.pi.action`: `.role.improver`_ must take a written action for every
improvement suggestion logged (`.log`_).

_`.pi.response`: Improvement suggestions should receive one of the
following responses:

_`.pi.edit`: "Edit: <tag> <detail>"

  edit of another document.  The detail is optional if it is obvious.

_`.pi.pass`: "Pass: <person>"

  passed to another person, who has accepted it.

_`.pi.raise`: "Raise: <tag>"

  elevated, usually to a request in MM Evolution.

_`.pi.reject`: "Reject: <reason>"

  rejected because it is not a valid issue.

_`.pi.forget`: "Forget: <reason>"

  it is a valid issue, but is not worth taking any action
  over. [Should we have this?]


5.8. Review Exit
----------------

[Sourced from [MM_proc.review.exit]_ and needs updating.  RB
2023-01-21]

_`.exit`: The *review exit procedure* is should be executed by
`.role.leader`_ and `.role.editor`_ after editing (`.edit`_).  The
purpose of exit is to check whether the revised change has passed
review.

[This text was in the phase section and may need to be incorporated here:

   The leader shall determine that some appropriate written action has
   been taken on all logged issues.  The leader is not responsible for
   the correctness (the editor is).

   The leader determines whether the formal exit criteria have been
   met before signing off completion of the Inspection.  These include
   follow-up completed, metrics delivered, planned rates kept to, and
   level of remaining defects within acceptable bounds.

RB 2023-01-23]

_`.exit.request`: The editor requests the leader to exit the document.  [Shouldn't this be in .edit?  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.exit.calc`: [Calculate and record final metrics using `.calc`_.  RB 2023-01-26]

_`.exit.record`: [Include details of how to record exit.  RB
2023-01-23]

_`.exit.check`: The leader checks that the document passes all
relevant exit criteria.  These should be indicated in review record.
 
_`.exit.check.fix`: If it doesn't pass all exit criteria, but it is
possible to fix it, he may either fix it himself, or return it to the
editor.

_`.exit.check.fail`: If the document cannot be made to pass exit (if,
say, there are two many estimated defects remaining), it may be passed
back to development, and reviewed subsequently.  The document remains
draft, and the review record becomes draft.  The reasons for failure
should be documented in the review record.

_`.exit.check.pass`: If it passes all criteria, the leader sets the
document status to "accepted" and the review record to "draft".  The
date of exit and any notes should be recorded in the review record.
The document is now suitable for release as appropriate.

_`.exit.inform`: The leader should inform all review participants and
some archived mailing list (such as "mm"), of the result of the
review, and any notes that seem appropriate.


6. Documents
============

[Sourced from [MM_process.review]_ and needs updating.  RB 2023-01-21]

_`.doc`: The review process involves a lot of documents.  This is a
brief explanation of what they are:

_`.doc.source`: Source document

  A document from which the product document is derived.  Note that
  this is nothing to do with source code.

_`.doc.product`: Product document

  The document developed from the source documents, and offered for
  review.  The work under review.  The changes under review.  The work
  product.  [Much of this procedure has been rephrased in term of
  reviewing a *change*, since this is a *change review procedure* and
  the tools, such as GitHub, focus on reviewing change.  Introducing a
  new product document is a change.  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.doc.record`: Review records

  A document of type "review" that records the results of reviewing
  one document.  This includes the issue log, and the brainstormed
  improvement suggestions.

  [This needs generalising to all kinds of records mentioned in this
  procedure, and updating to GitHub.  RB 2023-01-28]

  [All records must be specific, permanent, and referencable.  RB
  2023-01-28]

_`.doc.issue`: Issue log

  A record of issues raised during the logging meeting, specifying
  their location, type, finder, and a brief description.  The issue
  log also gives each issue an identifying number.

_`.doc.rev`: Revised document

  The result of performing the edit procedure on the Product document.

_`.doc.acc`: Accepted document

  The result of a Revised document passing exit.

_`.doc.rule`: Rule

  A rule set that a Product document is expected to obey.

_`.doc.guide`: Guidelines

  A "guide" document that a Product document may be expected to be in
  line with.  [Explain how this is distinct from rules.  RB
  2023-01-21]

_`.doc.check`: Checklist

  A list of questions, a negative answer to which indictes that a rule
  has been broken (see .doc.rule).

_`.doc.entry`: Entry criteria

  Criteria that should be met before review to ensure that the
  document is likely to pass exit.

_`.doc.proc`: Procedures

  Descriptions of the steps involved in completing any part of process
  (development, review, or otherwise).

_`.doc.imp`: Brainstormed improvement suggestions

  Suggested improvements to process (and hence to some document)
  arising from the process brainstorm.

_`.doc.request`: Requests for change

  An issue that the editor cannot deal with that is escalated to some
  other tracking system, usually MM Evolution (see process.darwin).


7. Calculations
===============

[This section was found in guide.review.edit but seems out
of place.  RB 2021-01-21]

_`.calc`: [Need to mention how this info is used.  Ref kpa.qpm.  RB
2023-01-26]

_`.calc.manpower-used`: The manpower used is the time for entry,
kickoff, checking, logging, brainstorm, edit, and exit.  Kickoff,
checking, logging and brainstorm must be multiplies by the number of
checkers.  Entry and kickoff may be assigned to another document
reviewed at the same time.

_`.calc.manpower-saved`: The default calculation is the number of
major defects found and fixed, multiplies by 10 man-hours.  This
represent the cost of a major defect found by QC.  If the defect would
have reached customers, the estimate should be 100 man-hours.  A
better estimate can be made, with justification.

_`.calc.defects-remaining`: The calculation of defects remaining
should use the estimate <major defects found>/<number of pages>.  The
obvious adjustment must be made for sampling.  The number of
unresolved major issues (raised) should be added.  [In an ideal world,
I believe we should know what proportion of major defects we find, and
use that.  Perhaps we could use 75%? - GavinM]


8. Checking Roles
=================

["Checking role" is too easily conflated with "review role" and should
perhaps be renamed to "method".  RB 2023-01-23]

_`.role.check`: Checking roles are assigned (`.plan.roles`_) to
`.role.checker`_ in order to focus their attention on different
aspects of the change under review, and so increase the number of
unique major defects found.

_`.role.check.backwards`: The *backwards checking role* involves
scanning the product document in reverse order, in order to increase
the chances of finding major defects that won't be found by other
checkers.  The checker should use their initiative in determining the
granularity of this reversal; for example: in an implementation, the
checker might read each function or type definition in turn from the
end of the file; for other documents, the checker might read each
subsection or paragraph from the end backwards.  For the convenience
of other checkers and the editor, the backwards checker should their
issues in forwards document order.  See `.log.order`_.  [This advice
may no longer be relevant with automated tools.  RB 2023-01-26]

_`.role.check.clarity`: The *clarity checking role* focuses on whether
the product document is clear and obvious.  This is a good role to
give to someone who has never seen the product document before, but
who is in the intended readership.  Anything that is unclear to them
is a defect.

_`.role.check.consistency`: The *consistency checking role* focuses on
whether the product document or documents are internally consistent.

_`.role.check.convention`: The *convention checking role* concentrates
on whether the product document complies with detailed conventions and
rules.

_`.role.check.correctness`: The *correctness checking role* focuses on
whether the product document is correct, i.e. will have the intended
consequences.

_`.role.check.source`: The *source checking role* concentrates on
whether the product document is consistent with any source documents,
and whether dependencies and links are documented where appropriate.


9. Issue Classification
=======================

[Imported from mminfo:guide.review.class and needs updating.  RB
2023-01-26]

_`.class`: There are many possible schemes for defect classification,
but only a coarse one is used here.  Any issue raised, must fall into
one of the following classes.  The normal abbreviation is indicated.

_`.class.major`: (M): A Major defect is a defect in the Product
document that will probably have significantly increased costs to find
and fix later in the development process, for example in testing or in
use ([Gilb_93]_ p442).  A bug that is fixed after review typically
takes one man-hour, after testing 10 man-hour, and in the field 100
man-hours.  A defect that will waste downstream development effort is
also major.  Typical major defects are:

- In an implementation, potentially failing to behave as specified;

- In an implementation, failing to validate foriegn data;

- In a high-level document, being likely to cause major defects in
  derived documents.

_`.class.minor`: (m): A minor defect is any defect in the Product
document whose cost to fix does not increase in time.  If there is a
typo, then it doesn't matter when it's fixed.  Typical minor defects
are:

- an implementation, poor variable names;

- in any human-readable text, typos where the meaning is clear.

_`.class.comment`: (C): A comment is any remark about the product
document.  Typical comments are:

- suggestions for how an algorithm could be optimised in future;

- praise.

_`.class.imp`: (I): An improvement suggestion is any potential defect
found in documents other than the product document.  Typical
improvement suggestions are:

- defects in source documents;

- defects in rule sets, check lists, or procedures.

_`.class.new`: (N): Any issue found during logging (as opposed to
during checking) is a new issue.  This classification is orthogonal to
the preceding.  It is important to mark new issues, in order to
measure how worthwhile group logging sessions are (see `.log.just`_).


11. Rationale
=============

Formal review is the key to the quality of the Memory Pool System.

A full justification of the review process described by this procedure
is not feasible here.  There are three sources:

1. the process improvement history of the Memory Pool System project,

2. Software Inspection [Gilb_93]_,

3. the analysis work behind the Capability Maturity Model
   [CMU/SEI-93-TR-024]_.

Of these, (1) is unfortunately the least accessible, because the
documents have travelled through several different systems, and
version control did not always survive.


11.1. Why formal reviews?
-------------------------

Ravenbrook does have hundreds of archived review records [MM_reviews]_
with estimates of review productivity (produced by
`.phase.estimation`_).  [At some point it would be good to summarize
those here.  RB 2023-01-28]

Every formal review has been worthwhile in terms of preventing defects
versus the cost of review.

The Harlequin MM Group adopted code review in the mid 1990s -- early
compared to most of the industry.  Casual code reviews (where someone
eyeballs diffs) have become standard practice for many projects, and
it's quite hard to imagine a time without them.  However, full-on
formal reviews or inspections are still relatively rare.

Formal review is appropriate for the MPS because defects in memory
managers, and especially in garbage collectors, are *extremely*
expensive to find and fix compared to other software.

It's the job of a garbage collector to destroy information by
recycling (overwriting) objects and reorganizing memory.  A subtle
failure of GC logic can cause a failure in the client software hours
later.  When that failure happens to a user of an application
delivered by developers using a compiler developed by your client that
uses the MPS in its runtime system, well, forget about it.  A defect
in the compiler (usually considered expensive) is relatively cheap!

This means that the cost of `major defects`_ escalates *much* more
steeply for the MPS than most software, so it is especially worthwhile
to catch them early in the development process.

Even testing is too late.
