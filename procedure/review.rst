1. Introduction
---------------

This document will contain a procedure for reviewing changes to the
MPS.

This is a placeholder while we arrange to bring in documents from
outside the MPS Git repository and tree.  For background, see `GitHub
issue #95 <https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps/issues/95>`_.

Since this document was created as part of `a project to migrate from
Perforce to Git (and GitHub)
<https://github.com/orgs/Ravenbrook/projects/1>`_, this procedure will
give specifics on conducting review via GitHub.  But the general
procedure is in no way specific to GitHub, Git, Perforce, or any other
tool.


[Notes for inclusion:
  - Review is not just (or even mostly) looking at diffs, though
GitHub encourages this idea.
  - History of MPS review.
  - Why review is so important to the MPS.]
