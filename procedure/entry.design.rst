_`.scope`: These entry criteria are to be used for reviews of design
documents.  Our aim is for failure to prevent entry.  In the meantime,
failure of one of these criteria must be documented in the review
document and entry prevention is at the leader's discretion.

_`.rfc`: Any design document entering formal review must have
previously been reviewed informally, e.g. by e-mail RFC, or design
brainstorm.
