1. Introduction
---------------

This document contains procedures for setting up virtual machines
suitable for development, building, and testing the Memory Pool
System.

The purpose is to allow an MPS developer to develop the MPS on one
physical machine while ensuring their work is correct on the MPS
target platforms.


2. Overview
-----------

There are two parts to a VM setup: the host setup and the guest
setup.

To keep things simple, these should be independent as far as possible,
partly for convenience, but partly to get reproducible results.  For
example, the way we set up a Windows guest on a Linux host should be
the same as the way we set up a Windows guest on a macOS host.

[Is it a good idea to duplicate CI environments?  Or is it a good idea
to *avoid* that to get more coverage?  RB 2023-01-13]

[Approach: We set up command-line non-graphical guests and connect to
them via their console or SSH or similar.  RB 2023-01-13]

[For development, we could share filesystems, or run Git on the guest,
or use something like Emacs TRAMP to work on the guest.  RB

3. Host setup
-------------

3.1. Linux host
...............

[virt-manager, LXD, VirtualBox]

[LXD is appropriate for checking compilation against compiler
toolchains and OS variants, but you're still running on the same
kernel, so it's not really good for testing the MPS.  Neither is a
QEMU/KVM really, but it's much better emulation.  RB 2023-01-14]


3.2. Windows host
..................

[VirtualBox]


3.3. macOS host
...............

[VirtualBox]


4. Guest setup
--------------

[Ref target platforms.]

[Where to get base images]

4.1. Linux guest
................

[Ubuntu or Debian, build-essential, git, clang/gcc]


4.2. Windows guest
..................

[Chocolatey, git, Visual Studio]


4.3. macOS guest
................

[git, homebrew, Xcode]


4.4. FreeBSD guest
..................

[git]
